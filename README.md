# ODSC Intro to Data Visualization

This repository contains the code covered in the talk, _A Practical Introduction to Data Visualization for Data Scientists_, at ODSC East 2024.

This is an [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework) project. After downloading the code or cloning the repo, open a shell and run the following command inside the directory:

```
npm install
```

To start the local preview server, run:

```
npm run dev
```

Then visit <http://localhost:3000> to preview your project.

## Google analytics example

This code was built on top of [the Framework Google Analytics example](https://github.com/observablehq/framework/tree/main/examples/google-analytics). Follow the instructions below (copied from the original README) to see your own GA data. In addition to changing the variables below, you will also have to delete the `.csv` files in the `data` folder.

This dashboard tracks data from Google Analytics using the [Google Analytics Data API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/quickstart-client-libraries). It contains a single page in `docs/index.md`.

View the [live project](https://observablehq.com/framework/examples/google-analytics/).

## Data loaders

To connect the data loaders to the Analytics API, you will need to set up a `.env` file at the root of this directory with three variables:

```
GA_PROPERTY_ID=111111111
GA_CLIENT_EMAIL=xxxx@yyy.gserviceaccount.com
GA_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nxxxxxxxxxx-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

There is also a hard-coded path in the data loaders (in this case, to define a `stringFilter` that restricts the loader to views on the Observable Plot documentation); you can modify it with a different path or remove it entirely.

The Google Analytics [API Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/quickstart-client-libraries) guide will walk you through how to set this up for your own instance of Google Analytics.

## Charts

The dashboard displays a variety of charts, made with [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/). With the key numbers at the top, a line chart or an area chart. Activity by country is represented by a choropleth map. Active users use a horizon chart, faceted by channel. The “new vs. returning” chart is a Marimekko. Finally, the activity by day and hour is a punchcard chart. The code for each of these charts is available in [docs/index.md](https://github.com/observablehq/framework/blob/main/examples/google-analytics/docs/index.md).
